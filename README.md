# 📊 Discipline Tracker

A minimalist habit tracking app designed to help you build consistency and maintain daily discipline through task completion and win/loss tracking.

## 🎯 What It Does

Discipline Tracker helps you monitor your daily habits and maintain accountability by:

- **Track Daily Tasks**: Manage mandatory and optional tasks with customizable completion thresholds
- **Win/Loss System**: Each day is evaluated as a Win or Loss based on your task completion
- **Streak Tracking**: Monitor current and best winning streaks to stay motivated
- **Visual Calendar**: See your progress at a glance with color-coded calendar days
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track win rates, perfect weeks, and performance metrics
- **Holiday Mode**: Mark days as holidays to exclude them from your streak calculations

## 💡 Why This Approach?

This app is built using **only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with **zero backend dependencies** because:

- **📱 Works Anywhere**: Run it directly on your phone, tablet, or computer without needing a server
- **🔒 Privacy First**: All your data stays on your device using localStorage - nothing is sent to any server
- **⚡ Lightning Fast**: No loading times, no internet required after initial page load
- **🎨 Fully Offline**: Track your habits even without internet connection
- **💾 Complete Control**: Your data belongs to you - export/import anytime

Perfect for anyone who wants a simple, private habit tracker that works on any device without installing apps or creating accounts.

## 🚀 How It Works

### Daily Workflow

1. **Check Your Tasks**: Each day, you'll see your list of mandatory and optional tasks
2. **Complete Tasks**: Check off tasks as you complete them throughout the day
3. **Save Your Day**: Click "Save Day" to evaluate the day as a Win or Loss
4. **Track Progress**: View your stats, streaks, and calendar to see your journey

### Win/Loss Logic

- **Mandatory Tasks**: Must complete ALL mandatory tasks

- **Win**: Both conditions met ✅
- **Loss**: Either condition failed ❌
- **Holiday**: Excluded from calculations 🏖️
